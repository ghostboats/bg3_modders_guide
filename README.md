Guide to creating mods for baulders gate 3
Please see the my github wiki for guides!The quickster mod is intened to be used as a follow along to the wiki guide.

I have also release my b3 mod template tool. Simply run the .exe and it will open up a gui that will let you create basic mod files in a more streamlined process. Currently you can make a basic class mod but it still requires alot of work. Use at own caution. UUUID's and handles auto link with the tool (for class related files only for now) and the tool will auto create a meta and localization file for you. Once done it will also pack and send your .pak to your mod folder to instause the mod. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Will release the source once I clean up my code a bit. Packing utilities come from the bg_modders_multitool made by shinyhobo.
